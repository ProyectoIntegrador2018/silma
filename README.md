## Development

### Setup the project

You'll definitely want to install [`plis`](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/plis), as in this case will
let you bring up the containers needed for development. This is done by running the command
`plis start`, which will start up the services in the `development` group (i.e. rails
and sidekiq), along with their dependencies (posgres, redis, etc).

After installing please you can follow this simple steps:

1. Clone this repository into your local machine

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:IcaliaLabs/crowdfront.git
```

2. Fire up a terminal and run:

```bash
$ plis run web bash
```

3. Inside the container you need to migrate the database:

```
% rails db:migrate
```

### Running the stack for Development

1. Fire up a terminal and run: 

```
plis start
```

That command will lift every service crowdfront needs, such as the `rails server`, `postgres`, and `redis`.


It may take a while before you see anything, you can follow the logs of the containers with:

```
$ docker-compose logs
```

Once you see an output like this:

```
web_1   | => Booting Puma
web_1   | => Rails 5.1.3 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
web_1   | => Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
web_1   | => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
web_1   | Listening on 0.0.0.0:3000, CTRL+C to stop
```

This means the project is up and running.

### Stop the project

In order to stop crowdfront as a whole you can run:

```
% plis stop
```

This will stop every container, but if you need to stop one in particular, you can specify it like:

```
% plis stop web
```

`web` is the service name located on the `docker-compose.yml` file, there you can see the services name and stop each of them if you need to.

### Restoring the database

You probably won't be working with a blank database, so once you are able to run crowdfront you can restore the database, to do it, first stop all services:

```
% plis stop
```

Then just lift up the `db` service:

```
% plis start db
```

The next step is to login to the database container:

```
% docker exec -ti crowdfront_db_1 bash
```

This will open up a bash session in to the database container.

Up to this point we just need to download a database dump and copy under `crowdfront/backups/`, this directory is mounted on the container, so you will be able to restore it with:

```
root@a3f695b39869:/# bin/restoredb crowdfront_dev db/backups/<databaseDump>
```

If you want to see how this script works, you can find it under `bin/restoredb`

Once the script finishes its execution you can just exit the session from the container and lift the other services:

```
% plis start
```

### Debugging

We know you love to use `debugger`, and who doesn't, and with Docker is a bit tricky, but don't worry, we have you covered.

Just run this line at the terminal and you can start debugging like a pro:

```
% plis attach web
```

This will display the logs from the rails app, as well as give you access to stop the execution on the debugging point as you would expect.

**Take note that if you kill this process you will kill the web service, and you will probably need to lift it up again.**

### Running specs

To run specs, you can do:

```
$ plis run test rspec
```

Or for a specific file:

```
$ plis run test rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb
```

### Checking code for potential issues

To run specs, you can do:

```
$ plis run web reek
```

```
$ plis run web rubocop
```

```
$ plis run web scss_lint
```

Or any other linter you have.
